<h1>Create a New Access Identity</h1>

<p>An Access Identity is basically an account that you have to make on this portal.</p>
<p>It allows you to have your own Access Folder which is securely encrypted for you to store data.</p>
<br>
<p>Each Access Identity is attached to a automatically generated login certificate.</p>
<p>This login certificate expires after 30 days which means that you will have to renew your certificate with a renewal code.</p>
<br>
<p>For now, enter some account details to get your first Access account!</p>
